Summary: What is tmux? Why we use tmux and its advantages?

## WHY TMUX

`tmux` is useful in different ways. To me, its most useful as a way to maintain
various windows and panels in a single terminal window. And also to maitain
peristent working states on remote servers, allowing you to detach and re-attach
at will.

## WHAT ABOUT SCREEN?

`tmux` is a lot like screen, only better. Few advantages of tmux over screen:
    - Tmux supports both emacs and vim shortcuts
    - Tmux support auto-renaming windows
    - Tmux is highly scriptable
    - Window splitting is more advanced in tmux
